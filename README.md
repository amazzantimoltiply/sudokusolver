Haskell is that kind of thing I always dreamed of learning since I started to Code and always postponed.
Finally I pushed myself to get out from the "imperative" confort zone and forced myself to spend an entire year to change my mind on coding.
Yes, in order to learn Haskell you need to give up to everything you know about the noble art of coding and start to re-learn the approach of picturing the world as populated by only functions. Here you can find my path to learn it, as always by experimenting and code.
